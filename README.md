## What is
TNT Duping is a Minecraft Bedrock addon that allows duplication of TNT using a note block, this allows you to modify slime mechanics (World Eaters, Quarries, etc.) to avoid wasting TNT with dispensers.

## How to use
To duplicate a tnt, a block of notes must be placed next to the tnt to be duplicated, when the tnt is activated it will be duplicated.
